## Welcome to Norns.Urd

Norns.urd is a lightweight AOP framework based on emit which do dynamic proxy

The purpose of completing this framework mainly comes from the following personal wishes:

- Static AOP and dynamic AOP are implemented once
- How can an AOP framework only do dynamic proxy but can work with other DI frameworks like `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`
- How can an AOP make both sync and Async methods compatible and leave implementation options entirely to the user

Hopefully, this library will be of some useful to you
